### About the tour:

The first part of the tour will be a presentation that explains what the plant does and how it functions. The second part will be the actual tour of the plant.

"The tour consists of a walk-thru of our Panelboard assembly line, which consists of Panelboards that range in amperage between 100A to 800A, followed by a tour of our switchboard assembly line. The switchboard assembly line ranges between 800A-3000A assemblies.

After the tour of the Panelboard/switchboard assembly line, we will move over to the Motor control center assembly line. The motor control line consist of a start to finish look on how an Eaton MCC is manufactured. We will look at the entire MCC manufacturing process from 120V wiring of the buckets to the 600A plus assembly of the main bus."
