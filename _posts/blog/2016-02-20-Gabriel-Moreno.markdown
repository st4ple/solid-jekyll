<b>Elena</b> was the first piece that made me fall for the style of Gabriel Moreno, a Spanish artist based in Madrid Spain. He has a way of illustrating with striking colors on top of a black and white base. 

Moreno is famous for his emphasis of the beauty of women in most of his works, as well as the tatoo-like illustrations that he places on his subjects' skin that seem to tell a story all their own.

As you can see from Elena above, some of his skin illustrations include pop culture like Batman and Superman. 
I have admired Gabriel Moreno's work ever since high school and I even wrote a complicated paper on how his work helped evolve what art is, given that he creates traditional and digital art. 
I actually tried to be ambitious, so I called his studio asking for an interview (in Spanish, second year learner at the time). 
However, he was in Dubai doing a show, so I was not able to get that interview done. Yet, I loved his work so much that I still focused on how his art tied technology with traditional art forms.

Moreno is fond of paper and pencil, but also uses a Wacom tablet and Photoshop. Personally, I have worked mostly with paper and pencil, but I am looking at integrating technology into my art, as well. 
Technology can help expand what people can do with art, but like Gabriel Moreno believes, we cannot forget the basics. 
Rather, new technology should mean expanding our arsenal in art and it shouldn't mean retiring the tools that came before it.
