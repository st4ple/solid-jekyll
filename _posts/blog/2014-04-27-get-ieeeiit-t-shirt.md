It's time to wear IEEE in pride! Our student branch has designed a T-shirt that will go on sale. Members who wish to get their own IEEE @ IIT T-shirt will have to pay a very minimal amount. Part of the actual cost of the T-shirt will be borne by the student branch. So, all you have to pay is fifty percent of the entire cost.

[Follow this link to purchase the T-shirt.](https://secure.touchnet.com/C20090_ustores/web/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCTID=1094&SINGLESTORE=true)
