Sathyanarayanan introduced all the executive board members to the audience, including the newly elected board members, Industry Chair: Sreeram Haridas, Publicity Chair: Isabelle Sophie Guitard, and Webmaster: Natasha Wijoyo.  He spoke mainly about the IEEE Region 4 Student Leadership Conference (SLC) that happened at Madison, Wisconsin during the first weekend of February. He mentioned about the workshops, competitions, and seminars that took place in the conference.

He also mentioned about the best instructor poll being conducted by the ECE department, to felicitate one faculty member based on votes by students. The nomination form will be sent out to students soon and they can fill up information about the professor they wish to nominate and send it back to the department. The last date to submit these forms will be March 11. The projects that are funded by IEEE, namely, Quadcopter, Guitar Amplifier, Microsoft Kinect, are currently looking for new members to join the teams and work on them. These projects are an opportunity for students to utilize the skills that they pick up from classrooms in a real-time scenario and understand the aspects of engineering an application.

The guest speaker for the event was Robert Burke, Student Branch Activity Chair at the IEEE Chicago Section. He explained to the students about professional careers and offered advice on what kind of jobs to pursue in order to have a successful career. Burke shared with the audience, his experiences in the field of engineering, and the jobs he worked in before his current position. He also answered student questions on what courses to study during their engineering education, which closely allies with the jobs they wish to attain.

The IEEE @ IIT student branch plans to have company tours, and general body meetings, that will be conducted every month, typically during the last week. They will also have their signature barbeque event, which will be held mostly during the last week of April owing to the weather permitting the odds of the event, since it is an outdoor event.
