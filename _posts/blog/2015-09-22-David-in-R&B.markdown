<b>Before we get started,</b>  no I am not talking about rhythm and blues. However, we could talk about that later. 
Today, I'm talking about Renaissance and Baroque.

<!--####Sample subtitle-->
To be more specific, the focus is the statue of David and the difference between potential and doing something with that potential. You'll see what I mean.
Most know about Michelangelo's sculpture of David, which stands at 5.17 meters (about 17 feet) and is made of Carrara marble. David is the biblical hero who played the giant Goliath with a rock and a slingshot. Michelangelo's depiction of the hero is before the battle. He appears to make his position look effortless. David is looking out at his target and does not have any movement. He is just looking out at a goal that needs to be accomplished, similar to how I see the growth of the Ebony Xscapers, which is what I'm going to call this community. David is out to to do something amazing, yet he just stands in the nude thinking about it. The sculpture is a symbol of what it means to look out at the future and recognize the potential you have to get there.

<!--####Sample subtitle-->
However, other statues of David were made, which typically depict David after he's whupped Goliath. Bernini's David is special because of some things that Michelangelo's David lacked, movement and effort. Bernini's David shows the biblical hero mid-swing. He's biting his lip and he's twisting his body, implying the effort. Going back to my Ebony Escapers analogy, I didn't just sit and think about what could happen if I built this community, I am building it. This shows that we have the ability to move and do something, so we should be moving. Another special thing about Bernini's David is that it feels like suspended animation in the round. What does that mean? It's like pausing a movie and being able to walk around in the scene.

<b>Both Davids give a different message to viewers.</b> Both are on a platform above the viewer. One can look up to a person who has an idea or wants to do something. Then, one can look up to a person who takes the idea and runs with it.
