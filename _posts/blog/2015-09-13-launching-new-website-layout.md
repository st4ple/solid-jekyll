Hey all!

I hope you are doing well! I would like to announce the launching of the new layout. This layout gives more visual, and the IEEE Executive Board believes the new layout makes it more efficient for us to do announcements and to give you guys the updates on projects, etc. 

Let us know what you think about the new layout! I'm still trying to fix this and that, so you might still see bugs here and there. I will try fixing them one by one, so please bear with me!

If you are interested in joining the IT Committee and learn how you can contribute to our website development, feel free to e-mail me at nwijoyo@hawk.iit.edu
