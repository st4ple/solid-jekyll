Last week we have [set-up](http://blogs.rhrk.uni-kl.de/mindgarage/2016/10/the-mindgarage-is-born/) the MindGarage. As a small token of appreciation, [Marcus](http://blogs.rhrk.uni-kl.de/mindgarage/marcus-liwicki/) invited the volunteers to a dinner at the Saigon restaurant. It was a gorgeous dinner and we had nice discussions about what we are going to do in the MindGarage. Some impressions below.
