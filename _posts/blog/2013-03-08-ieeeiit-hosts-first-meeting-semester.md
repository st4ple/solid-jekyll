The IEEE Student Chapter at IIT had their first general meeting of this semester on Thursday, 28 February in the Siegal hall auditorium. Since it was the first meeting students were curious about the agenda. George Williams, Secretary of the Students Chapter, on behalf of the President started the discussion by introducing the IEEE@IIT members to the students and then speaking about the meeting agenda including the introduction of new executive board members, upcoming IEEE@IIT events, internship matching, projects funded by IEEE and scholarships awarded by IEEE as well as announcing a T-shirt contest. After the introduction of members, George spoke about the upcoming events, like a barbecue party planned after Spring break. Upcoming events will be notified to students via e-mail and the Facebook group.

Students seeking internship have an opportunity to apply via IEEE. All that is needed is to send their resume &#x74;&#x6f;&#x69;&#x65;&#x65;&#x65;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x69;&#x69;&#x74;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75; (the official email id of IEEE@IIT). There are few projects that are funded by IEEE, like Raspberry Pi, Quadcopter, Mutitouch project, Guitar Amp and Ardupilot. The first project meeting is scheduled for 14th March in the Galvin Center, located in the IIT Tower, 16th floor. As per the recent announcement, the Raspberry Pi project has received the maximum attention among students. Hence, that project is expected to be discussed elaborately. After the commencement of projects, the meeting office would be shifted to Seigal Hall basement. George asked the interested students to talk to IEEE@IIT members, or mail them if they have any queries about the projects. They have also created an online sign-up sheet for the project participation.

Talking about the scholarships awarded by IEEE, there are currently three scholarships open to IEEE members viz., the Richard E. Merwin Student Scholarship, Lance Stafford Larson Student Scholarship and Upsilon Pi Epsilon Scholarship. Bidusha Poudyal, one of the scholarship holders, who is also in the executive body, strongly encouraged applying for the scholarships. Students who are interested in graph/logo designing have an opportunity to design the IEEE T-shirt, and get awarded a whopping $100. Finally, the meeting ended with membership queries. George and other members explained what benefits one gets after he/she is an IEEE student member. All queries regarding IEEE@IIT can be forwarded to &#x69;&#x65;&#x65;&#x65;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x69;&#x69;&#x74;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;.
