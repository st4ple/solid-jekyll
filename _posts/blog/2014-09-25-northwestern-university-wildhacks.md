Northwestern University's IEEE Student Branch is sponsoring WildHacks ([WildHacks.org](http://wildhacks.org)). On the weekend of November 22nd-23rd, more than 400 of the most talented student developers are going to gather together to build things like mobile apps, websites, and hardware devices to show off their skills.

The section is also organizing speakers and tours, trying to include as many members as possible.

What we need:

1.  **Branch Mentors.**
    Members are needed to work with one of the student branches, keeping them on task and helping them organize events. We have one each for IIT and Northwestern, but are in need of members for the others. The time commitment is minimal, and it’s a great to help engineers just starting out on their careers.
2.  **Sponsors**
    We are in need of sponsors for some of the student events above. If you can donate some funds for food, prizes, project supplies, and more, it would be much appreciated.
3.  **Speakers**
    The students are always looking for speakers for regular student meetings. Have a topic or want to meet the students? Let me know.  Note that these are typically open meetings and will involve more than just IEEE student members.
4.  **Tours**
    Have a facility that would make a good tour? Let us know - we’re looking for places to take students to show them working in the real world is like.

If you have any questions or would like to help, please sent me an email at Robert.burke@ieee.org or Robert.burke@culligan.com
