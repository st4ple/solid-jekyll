<p><b>Mete Morris</b></br>
<u>Nominated by:</u> Ming Chen</br>
<u>Current year in school:</u> Undergraduate (1st year)</br>
<u>Why are you interested in this position?</u></br>
•	I have been working with IEEE Kinect Project since January 2015 and I have been a member IEEE@IIT since I came to IIT.</br>
•	I have taken leadership positions in past. I was the president of my High School Student Government and currently I am a Senator in SGA and the co-president of a soon to be official Model United Nations @IIT. My experience better equips me for the challenges of being the Vice-President of IEEE so that I will take on this role successfully.</br>
•	I was very excited when I heard about IEEE at IIT and still have the same excitement. I am willing to devote as much time as possible to IEEE. Of recent, there has only been one active project in IEEE as a few problems have developed in the other projects. My biggest goal would be to revive the old projects and add new ones by collaborating with the Project Chair. I have worked in many team projects before and I have knowledge about creating a good team environment and helping the Executive Board run smoothly and effectively. I am very good at organizing and keeping track of progress and will be able to help the future president keep track of events. It is my true desire to make IEEE@ IIT better. Why I am interested in this position? Because I know that once granted the position I can make a difference, improving both myself and the organization.

<p><b>Jay Sharma</b></br>
<u>Nominated by:</u> Jay Joshi</br>
<u>Current year in school:</u> Graduate (Masters, PhD)</br>
<u>Why are you interested in this position?</u></br>
Eagerly waiting for a platform which shall provide me an opportunity to use my talent and benefit the organization. I have been a part of IEEE during my undergraduate. I have strong knowledge on the benefits of being an IEEE member and can market it well.

<p><b>Javier Sorribes Camargo</b></br>
<u>Nominated by:</u> Aditya Parakh </br>
<u>Current year in school:</u> Undergraduate (1st year)</br>
<u>Why are you interested in this position?</u></br>
I think that IEEE needs diversity. I come from Spain with a very strong background and awesome ideas that will make IEEE @ IIT move forward!!!

<p><b>Aditya Parakh</b></br>
<u>Nominated by:</u> Javier Sorribes </br>
<u>Current year in school:</u> Undergraduate (1st year)</br>
<u>Why are you interested in this position?</u></br>
I was born in New Delhi, India. I spent my childhood years in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. I then spent my teenage years growing up in Bangkok, Thailand. I believe that this diverse background puts me in the position where I can help take advantage of IIT's diverse population. IIT has a lot of undergraduates/graduates in the ECE department but very few are actually part of IEEE. I firmly affirm that with my communication skills, I will be able to reach a wider audience. </br></br>

I have had a lot of leadership positions in High School and I feel that I can bring that experience with me to IEEE. I was the president of the Media Department of the Student Council in my High School. My tasks included communicating with other members in the Student Council to come together and make artwork for the school. Communication is the key to success and I postulate that this will help IEEE move forward and reach new levels. </br></br>

Fear stifles our thinking and actions. It creates indecisiveness that results in stagnation. I have known talented people who procrastinate indefinitely rather than risk failure. Lost opportunities cause erosion of confidence, and the downward spiral begins. </br></br>

With Adi, there is an unseen future for IEEE. A future we can trust in, believe in. A future that will set an example for times to come.

<p><b>Viral Mehta</b></br>
<u>Nominated by:</u> Jay Joshi </br>
<u>Current year in school:</u> Graduate (Masters, PhD)</br>
<u>Why are you interested in this position?</u></br>
I have been passionate about managing and organizing events. I have worked in this domain at volunteering as well as professional level. I have been a part of college festivals (undergraduate). Also my work experience included a lot of management and organizational skills. This makes me a fit for the position of Program Chair at IEEE-IIT

<div onClick="openClose('a6')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer"><h3>Project Chair</h3></div>
<div id="a6" class="texter">
<p><b>Brandon Dotson</b></br>
<u>Nominated by:</u> Ming Chen </br>
<u>Current year in school:</u> Undergraduate (3rd year)</br>
<u>Why are you interested in this position?</u></br>
I am interested in this position because I have been working on an IEEE project for two consecutive semesters. In this short span of time, I have seen our project go from being one that did not work too well to relatively successful. From this, I believe I have a good sense of what to look for when it comes to how projects are handled.</br></br>

For IEEE@IIT, I want our projects to thrive. Our school's ECE students need to have a place to develop themselves outside of the classroom. It is a good opportunity for hands-on learning and new friendships. Experiencing this firsthand motivates me to put in additional time and effort into revitalizing some of our dead projects, regardless of how many others are interested.</br></br>

I just want to get past the feeling of doubt most students have, and show everyone that these projects are a chance to take a short break from our regular school work, have fun, and learn something new together."

<p><b>Nikita Vijay Chandapur</b></br>
<u>Nominated by: </u></br> 
<u>Current year in school:</u> Graduate (Masters, PhD)</br>
<u>Why are you interested in this position?</u></br>
I have been an active member of IEEE from my Undergraduate years, be it involving in organizing events or in the projects for IEEE. I have also been a member of student committee in Undergrad, where we would resolve the issues of the students, answer their queries. I believe that, as a Project Chair, I would be responsible for the undergoings in IEEE, IIT Chapter and in return, I would be learning a lot of things.
