EPIC, a student entrepreneurship group at Northwestern University, will
be hosting the largest ever intercollegiate hackathon NU has ever seen.

EPIC's mission at NU is to empower the next generation of entrepreneurs.
We understand what it's like to have a thirst for solving problems.
We've seen firsthand what teams of motivated individuals can pull out of
thin air in little time and under intense pressure.

We make it our mission to support students applying their skills in
creating tangible solutions to real-world problems.

**So come join us November 22nd thru 23rd as we host hundreds of hackers competing
against each other for cash prizes while united in their desire to turn
visions into reality.**

COME BUILD SOMETHING GREAT. COME BE EPIC.
