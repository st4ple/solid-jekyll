<b>The Creator</b> is someone who creates, or makes. You may think "well make what?" Well, the what is irrevelant. It just matters that you create. The idea of the Creator is extremely significant to me because I believe the world was created by God, as I am a Christian. Eveything and everyone seems so individualistic and unique that it seems to be an intricate pot made by a masterful potter.

With this thought in mind, I am just so fascinated by all the things that are available in this world and the people who contribute by making something, specfically in the arts and in technology.

I have always been someone engaged by artistic endeavours, but upon entering college I was repeatedly reminded that the arts "would not feed me." I understood that, but my heart is still set on the arts even in the midst of my technology related major.

<b>However,</b> I grew up singing, dancing, writing, playing instruments, acting, and creating visual art. Focusing on my technoglogical major has caused frequent feelings that I don't have time to work on my art, that I may have to just lose it, and that it would continue to be a full-time dream. I did something called soul searching and found through various "What should I do with my life" quizzes, reading old journal entries, and looking at old projects that the arts is forever in my heart. Another thing to consider is that there are various things and people in this world that inspire me.

####Sharing is Caring
I then realized that I just had to find a way. My way was to create this wesbsite and tell you about things and people that interest me and inspire me. Along with these retellings, I want to share my creative work with you! I will make sure that everyone is aware of my posts and projects.
