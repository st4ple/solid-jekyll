*If you want to participate in an IEEE project,* you **must** have prior
safety training. Student shop training and lab training is acceptable,
but you are still encouraged to attend. **The Office of Campus Life will
be holding a safety training session this Wednesday, October 8th, at
1:00pm in Perlstein Hall 109 and if you have not attended one before,
you are required to.** It should last no longer than 30mins.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
