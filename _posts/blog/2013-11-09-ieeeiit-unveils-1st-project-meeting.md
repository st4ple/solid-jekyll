Last week, the IEEE Student Chapter at IIT had their first project meeting of fall 2013 semester. The meeting took place on 7th November in the MTCC auditorium, and the turn- out was also very good.

Although IEEE@IIT organized many programs in this semester which includes their general body meeting, industrial tour, BBQ; the project meeting was the first of this semester. Juan Wang, Project Chair of IEEE@IIT chaired the meeting, and was accompanied by other executive members of the board. Juan introduced the students about the different projects with IEEE@IIT. The projects that are funded by IEEE are Quadcopter, Multi-touch project, Guitar Amplifier and Ardupilot. She shared the details on current progress, funding, and upcoming projects. Then she handed over the task of explaining each project to the individual team leader.

Rohit Agarwal, project leader of Guitar Amplifier, spoke about the current standing of the project. Talking about the different equipment’s they procured, and several tests performed to see that each equipment is working; his team is now ready to finally assemble the model. He invited other students to join the project as it would help them see classroom theory in action; learn hands-on experience, and eventually build-up resume.

Similarly, Peyton Zellar-Av, project leader of QuadCopter, gave an overview of the current status the project. The goal of their team is to successfully build a user-programmable Quadcopter, and have it flying by spring 2014. Their project is being advised by Prof. John Kallend, Professor of Materials Engineering.

Ardupilot group members described how they’re learning about “Arduino” by breaking it down to 10 different small projects. In fact, they have named their group as “Arduino Study Group.” Talking about their future plans and deadlines, the group has planned to finish the ArduPilot simulation by Dec 2013/Jan 2014, building the sailplane by February 2014 and completing the ArduPilot UAV by May 2014. Meanwhile, they are also planning to collaborate the ArduPilot project with the QuadCopter project in spring 2014 so as to enhance their wiring and programming issues.

Juan, who is also the project leader of Multi-touch project, spoke about their current standing. Currently, they have nine students working in the team. She talked about the various hardware and software enhancements that the group has planned to do in future. And, that included building a frame to fix the screens together and electric circuit to protect the LEDs, achieve human-computer interaction, and correctly compile the source-codes.

At the end, Eric Tendian, webmaster of IEEE@IIT, showed the new IEEE@IIT website to the attendees, launched last week. Any student interested in working on any of the project can mail to [&#x69;&#x65;&#x65;&#x65;&#x40;&#x69;&#x69;&#x74;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;](mailto:&#x69;&#x65;&#x65;&#x65;&#x40;&#x69;&#x69;&#x74;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75).
