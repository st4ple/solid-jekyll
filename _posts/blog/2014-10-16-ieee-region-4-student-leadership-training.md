Dear IEEE Student Branch officers,

My name is Flor Albornoz, and I am part of the Conference Committee for the
IEEE Student Branch at Purdue University-West Lafayette. As you may already
know, Purdue University will be hosting this year's Region 4 Student
Leadership Training. The training will be a concise and compressed version
of what the Student Leadership Conference usually is. It will be a one day
event taking place on *Saturday, October 25th* from 10:00 AM EDT to 4:00 PM
EDT at the Stewart Center on our West Lafayette campus. Our Student Branch
is diligently working on making SLT a great networking, learning, and
hands-on event to have a great impact on your Student Branch as well as
personal development.

As the time for SLT approaches and to meet our time constraints, we would
like to reach out to you to get an estimate amount of IEEE members from
your Student Branch that are interested in attending SLT. Below is an link
to RSVP for SLT. We would truly appreciate it if you could please pass on
this information to your Student Branch members. Please, RSVP ASAP to make
final arrangements for the event.

## [RSVP here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1d1PibwM-VmBjYoECT00LVFNCCgca3CCWm1lqiQlnnp8/viewform?usp=send_form)

Thank you very much to the Student Branches that have already signed up for
SLT. We truly appreciate your cooperation in this event.

If you have any questions, please feel free to send me an email. We hope to
see you at the Student Leadership Training!

Thank you for your cooperation,

Flor Albornoz<br>
