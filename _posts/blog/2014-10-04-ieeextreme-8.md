## 24hr Xtreme Programming Challenge: October 18th

## [*Register your team (or as an individual) by October 4th*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/138qy6gWxNE6uXvLn-21uaXTq7FkElAGwBBUmIDpCZVI/viewform?usp=send_form)

Interested in coding? Like competitions? Start getting a team of up to three together for the annual international IEEEXtreme Coding Challenge! IEEEXtreme is a 24-hour coding competition where you are given a set of coding problems you have to solve.

Teams from around the world compete in a 1-day contest to solve complex programming problems. The worldwide winning 3-person team gets a trip to an IEEE event anywhere in the world! *To make things interesting, the Chicago Section is putting up a $1,500 prize to the team that wins in Chicago.*

Last year there were 2000 teams around the world, with 7 from Chicago. We hope to make a good showing this year. Teams must consist of three IEEE National student members. You can recruit your fellow students by informing them that a full year's membership is only $40, including Computer Society membership.

We will have a local competition site, and will also provide food and refreshments during the competition. Information about the competition is on the IEEE website at [www.ieee.org/xtreme](http://www.ieee.org/membership_services/membership/students/competitions/xtreme/index.html), but we're currently working on finding a proctor. Stay tuned for further details, including the proctor!
