The students were very enthusiastic about the T-shirt design contest. Around 10 design nominations were shown to the audience, and the winner would be awarded a whopping $100 and the winning design would also be printed. There are a few upcoming company tours organized by IEEE@IIT. The first one is the ComEd West Loop Substation Tour, which was organized Friday 5th April. There is also another company tour to S&C Electric on 19th April and the deadline to sign-up is 15th April. Moreover, possible future tours to companies like Motorola Mobility, Nokia-Siemens Networks, GE are being discussed.

Discussing the projects that are funded by IEEE, like Raspberry Pi, Quadcopter, the Mutitouch project, Guitar Amp and Ardupilot, George asked the interested students to attend the project meeting in the Galvin Center at IIT Tower, 16thfloor on 11th April. A video showcasing the Raspberry Pi project was shown in the meeting too. Although the design is not going to be the same as in video, a general idea about what to do in the project was easily inferred from the video. Juan Wang, PhD scholar talked about the Multitouch project that she will also be responsible for heading. Showing a video on creating a Multitouch tablet, she said that the project would have some similar design steps. Interested students can still join any of the projects by signing the online sheet created for project participation, and attending the next project meeting on 11th April.

The nominations for IEEE@IIT executive board were open till 7th April. Elections will be held on 22nd April until 25thApril, right before the next general meeting. Till the election date, one can campaign for his/her nominee. The IEEE Spring barbeque will be held on 26th April at the Siegel Field, where you have the opportunity to meet the new executive members as well interact with other group members.
