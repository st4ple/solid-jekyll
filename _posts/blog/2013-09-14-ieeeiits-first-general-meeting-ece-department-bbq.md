The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Student Chapter at IIT had their first general body meeting of this semester on Wednesday, September 11, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering had a welcome barbeque for all the new-coming and transfer students on Friday, September 13 in front of Siegal Hall. The barbeque event was aimed to introduce the new Department Chair, Professor Ashfaq A. Khokhar. Professor Geoffrey Williamson who was the interim chair introduced Dr. Khokhar to the new students.

The first general meeting of IEEE@IIT was a grand success. The Wishnick Hall auditorium, where the meeting occurred was packed with students mainly because of Goldman Sachs’ presence. George Williams, Industry chair of IEEE@IIT, started the meeting by introducing the IEEE@IIT executive board to the students and then spoke about the agenda which included IEEE-sponsored projects, upcoming events/tours, IEEE competitions/conferences and IEEE@IIT calendar.

Juan Wang, Project Chair of IEEE@IIT gave a brief overview of all four IEEE-sponsored projects. The projects that are funded by IEEE are Quadcopter, Muti-touch project, Guitar Amp and Ardupilot. IIT students are highly encouraged to work on any of these projects. This was followed by a short speech by a representative from Goldman Sachs. Two students who interned at Goldman Sachs last summer also talked to the students about the benefits of interning there and advised to visit their stall at the Career Fair.

IEEE@IIT has plans to conduct tours to the Microsoft Technology Center, S&C Electric and many more activities that will be announced later. Also, students have the chance to participate in an online competition called IEEEXtreme. The organization is seeking students to fulfill the vacant positions of Program Chair, Newsletter Editor and Webmaster.

Anyone interested can contact IEEE at [&#x69;&#x65;&#x65;&#x65;&#x40;&#x69;&#x69;&#x74;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;](mailto:&#x69;&#x65;&#x65;&#x65;&#x40;&#x69;&#x69;&#x74;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75). Students will be notified about upcoming events/meetings via e-mail and the Facebook page.
