<b>Sometimes<b>, I am overwhelmed by my fellow Computer Information Systems majors that are thinking about tech startups or working in offices when I just want to immerse myself in the arts and be a little bit of a tech enthusiast. For instance, I currently have an internship in which I am a Web Developer/Designer. This is actually fantastic because as an artist I need to promote myself in as many ways as possible. For instance...
####Blogging 
 <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>is my go-to for my website developing. Why? Well...my website is totally FREE! I am an undergraduate in college so free is really good right now. Even if I am not sharing a project that is coming up, I can still share the everyday journey. Also, I like to recommend things like music or talk about something that I think is amazing. For me, time is irrelevant, so when it comes to things like music, I will recommend songs from artists that I think are great no matter the time. Some people may say "that song came out last month and why you are still listening to it?"

This gets on my nerves because art is something that is to stand the test of time. If it wasn't, then artists like Michael Jackson should be so yesterday. Well, obviously they are not "so yesterday." Jackson's art has influenced people like Bruno Mars and Janelle Monae and his work still gets millions of views on YouTube. Additionally, the songs that are not as popular are fantastic, but I will talk about that in the future.
####Social Media
I love Social Media, which is funny because I used to hate it. Why? I came from the land of high school girls who thought that putting up immature things every 30 minutes was fun. I thought social media was superficial and boring. Now, I use Twitter to follow news channels,  actors, writers, dancers, youtubers and all the other people who inspire me. Also, Pinterest is so much fun because I love collecting things, like art, places that look amazing, tips for college life, and even more things to add to my digital scrapbook.
Besides, the great web development and marketing aspect, I will develop a better head for business and that's a huge plus!

####Tamar Davis
This is a little segment in which I am going to highlight a Creator or Creators (depends on the day). Today, Ashley Tamar Davis is catching my attention. Recently, I discovered her holistic set of talents. I have only seen her in magnificent Tyler Perry Productions, like The Marriage Counselor and Laugh to Keep from Crying (one of my favorites). However, I had to look twice when I saw that she was going to be traveling with <a href="http://www.motownthemusical.com/index.php">Motown the Musical</a>summer 2016 and even better she has a pretty snazzy looking website. I saw her story that the arts were in her since childhood. Early on, she even almost got to meet Prince! My reason for talking about her is that she shows that Creators will always find their way to their destined track. Tamar put in the work and continues to put it in. Additionally, the fact that I only knew one section of her creative journey, shows that the life of an artist may have a magnificent product, but the work that goes into the product is comparable to how a glacier seems to have a humongous top, but really the base is bigger. Have a good weekend!
