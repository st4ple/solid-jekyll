###Who are we?
Vessel is an early stage consumer-focused video venture founded by Jason Kilar (founding CEO of Hulu and former Senior Vice President at Amazon.com) and Richard Tom (former CTO of Hulu). As a team, we are unusually passionate about the intersection of media and technology; we see an opportunity to improve media, particularly next generation video. 
###What are we looking for?
We're looking for our second class of Software Development Interns. As a Vessel intern, you will play an important role, working alongside software developers, designers and product managers on core features and services. No research or pet projects here. By the end of your internship you will have designed, implemented and deployed your project to production. We're looking for a developer who is well armed for tackling big projects.
###Reasons to be Excited:

* We believe that the most important factors to our success are our team and culture.
* We are incredibly excited and confident about our journey.

* We're located right in the heart of SOMA with the city and all of it's great food, music and nightlife at our doorstep.  

###Technology Stack:
We're big believers in trusting the team to debate and select the right tools for the job. This belief leads to a development team that is excited by and comfortable with building in a variety of languages, frameworks and platforms. We don’t expect that you have experience with these tools but we do expect that you have the tenacity to learn. Here's a short list of some of the current technology and tools we use to fuel the team.

###Engineering Challenges:
Vessel is a customer focused technology company whose mission is to build platforms and services that delight both consumers and content creators alike. If our engineering team had to be recognized for one thing we would want that to be Quality.
We believe in owning and building our core services. With that, we recognize that we must be armed with a team that includes both full stack and specialized developers. Here are few of the experiences we're looking for in our dev team:  
* Full stack responsive web development
* Device platforms and hybrid applications development
* Deep knowledge of video encoding and transcode farms  
* Architect & implement a distributed data analysis and metrics platform  
* Design & implement machine learning models that evaluate hundreds of features  
* Architect and implement services handling thousands of requests per second  
* Design & implement software to automate, scale, and streamline dev operations  
* Contribute back to the open source community in meaningful ways  

###Our Values
We've found that the two biggest drivers of success in business are a world-class team and a world-class culture, where culture is defined as the collective values of an organization. These values define us:
Customer focus: We are here first and foremost to delight our customers.
* Innovation: We are relentless in our pursuit of better ways.  
* Ambition: We think big and then get to the hard work of making it so.  
* Atypical quality bar: We set our standards at levels that many might consider too high.  
* Humility: We believe those that achieve great things are often also great in humility.  
* Long term thinking: We're here to build something special, which will require a long term mindset. If you'd rather hop from company to company, this is not the place for you.  

###Qualifications/Requirements
* Pursuing BS, MS or PhD in Computer Science or related field  
* At least one (2-3 preferred) internship(s) / co-op(s)  
* A solid foundation in computer science, with strong competencies in data structures, algorithms and software design  
* Strong object-oriented skills preferred  
* High levels of creativity and quick problem solving capabilities  
* Ability to thrive in a dynamic, fast-paced environment  
* Ability to handle multiple tasks with minimal oversight
