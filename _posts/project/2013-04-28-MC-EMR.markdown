####Mobile Clinic Electronic Medical Records
Provides a robust, reliable system for managing patient records during triage.
Patient records are added/modified on iPads. Patients can be registered or looked up using their fingerprint when paired with a Tactivo fingerprint reader.
Records are synchronized with a local server running on a MacBook Air.
Records are synchronized between the local server and a cloud server where records can be viewed.
