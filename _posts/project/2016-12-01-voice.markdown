### What is Voice?
With an idea of using state of the art embodied sensors to track hand gestures and classify signs in Indian Sign language and convert that to speech, We are developing this open-source project using MYO-armband, Deep LSTMs with Connectionist Temporal Classifiers. This project is meant to be a starting point for anyone who is interested in doing further research in the same field or topic.

#### Status
This project is under development so if you are interested in working in it then please drop an email to us. We would be glad to collaborate.
