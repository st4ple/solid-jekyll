		The University is home to Liberty Hall Museum a historic landmark housing some of the last undiscovered treasures of the American Revolution and the birth of our nation. The University officially acquired Liberty Hall in 2007. Our History Department currently is cataloguing thousands upon thousands of previously undiscovered manuscripts from the Revolutionary War period on.
