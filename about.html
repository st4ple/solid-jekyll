            <h4>What is IEEE@IIT?</h4>
            <p>IEEE@IIT is Illinois Tech's student chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). We are a student-run organization within the ECE Department at the Illinois Institute of Technology. We're a group of electrical/computer engineering and computer science students (undergrad and graduate) who want to have fun and meet new people, to learn about research and innovation in technology, to find ourselves and our passions, to help our community, and to get inspired to change the world!

Our mission is to provide a social, technical and professional community to the ECE student body. We want to help our ECE community gain knowledge, skills and networks that will help them through their academic and professional careers.
