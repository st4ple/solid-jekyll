            <p>My name is Jessica and I love the arts. Hands down! I am now in my sophomore year in college and I am majoring in Computer Information Systems, but I have been missing the arts.</p>
            <p>I wanted to do something about that because as an aspiring Creator, I have heard the "you'll be broke" and I like to challenge myself academically, so I'm in the Honors College. I also did International Baccaulareate in high school, but in both settings, I felt a little overwhelmed by my peers who want to be doctors, researchers, and the like.</p>
            <p>I am trying to reach out and say that being a Creator in the arts is something to be proud of! Now, I'm trying to blend it with tech, erego this site. In my opinion, I think it makes me feel closer to Jehovah because he is the ultimate Creator.</p>
            <p>I want to share my content and connect. I encourage you to engage with me through social media too! As you will see, I do not only share about my work, but the work of other Creators that I find to be awesome.</p>
