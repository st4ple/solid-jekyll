            <h4>What is a Hack-A-Thon you ask?</h4>
            <p>It's like a marathon, but stinkier.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to help build an (even) better Boise by bringing together our local community of:
            <ul>
              <li>not-for-profit organizations,</li>
              <li>for-profit sponsors,</li>
              <li>developers and designers,</li>
            </ul> thus, creating mutual benefit and all-around radness!</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>So how does this all actually go down, you ask?</h4>
          <p>On October 28th at 9am, we will meet at <a href="http://trailheadboise.org/about/" target="_blank">Trailhead</a>, sign in, and receive a packet containing the rules of the event, and descriptions of the participating non-profits.</p>
          <p>Developers and designers will choose the organization they would like to hack for and proceed to both meet and greet. Perhaps a short duration of ice-breakers to facilitate team-building will follow.<p>
          <p>48 hours later the hacking will stop to allow a neutral group of wizards and community leaders will judge the entries and then on October 30th at a celebretory luncheon - the winners will be announced and mad prizes issued.<p>
          <h4>What exactly are these mutual benefits, you ask?</h4>
          <p>The developer / designers get out of our caves and recieve free beer, caffeine, and pizza. Also, real world work experience for the newbies and mentoring / leadership creds for the wizards are welcomed. New tricks shall be learned by both the young pups and the old dawgs. Also, mad prizes!</p>
          <p>The non-profit orgs gain a new website, application, or other tech tool to help them solve their woefully underfunded, yet vitally important mission. As well as forge lasting relationships with the (well-paid) tech community in our fair city! And not just to hit them up for donations come tax season, bu for free consulting as well!</p>
          <p>The for-profits get to market their desire to appear to support the local tech talent, head-hunt said talent, and generate synergy (or somesuch other blither blather) See how good natured they are about a little ribbing! These sponsors are amazing! I want to work for people like this! Which is exactly why I organized this thing in the first place... duh.</p>
          <h4>So, what are you waiting for?<h4>
          <p> This is the new bowling league. Participation in groups alliviates alienation and depression. You are smart and talented and need to be appreciated for that more often, especially by people other than the ones who usually pay you for it. Doing good feels good damnit!<p>
