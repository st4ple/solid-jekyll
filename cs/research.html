            <h3> HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DEPARTMENT COMPUTER SCIENCE </h3> 
			<h4>RESEARCH</h4>
			<p>
				Computer Science department is engaged and committed to incept projects of institutional and national importance in the themes of Research,
				Innovation and Technology Transfer. These projects involve local, regional and international collaborations and networks and building strategic
				partnerships.<br>
				<br>The overarching aims of the projects are to:
				    <ul>
						<li>Strengthen the Department of Computer Science and University's 
						research capacity- this is to provide a concrete realization of the 
						university research strategy and vision;</li>
						<li> Stimulate multidisciplinary intra and inter faculty research,</li>
						<li>Enhance local, regional and international collaborations and to provide
                            outreach and visibility.</li>
						<li>Develop capacity in Innovation, Technology Transfer and Intellectual
                            Property</li>
						<li>Stimulation of grassroots innovation and interfacing with Technology
                            Transfer Offices and Incubators.</li> <br>
					</ul>
			</p>
			<h5>e-Health RESEARCH CLUSTER</h5>
			<p>
					The main aim of the research cluster is to provide a centre to bring together
                    people and projects which are concerned with undertaking research in the field of
                    health informatics, especially mobile health which is relevant for a country with
                    low resources such as Botswana. The cluster has secured a laboratory at the
                    Faculty of health Sciences which currently has 5 Personal computers dedicated
                    to 5 specific projects. <br>

			 <h5>MOBILE COMPUTING RESEARCH AND INNOVATION LABORATORY</h5>
            
			        <p>
				         The department is setting up a Mobile Computing Research and Innovation Lab
                         (MCRL). MCRL aims to provide capacity building and upskilling of researchers,
                         innovators, and entrepreneurs to help in exploring technology intervention in
                         solving local problems. The proposed lab will stimulate research and innovation
                         in mobile computing and applications to find technology solutions of local
                         relevance across sectors of health, education, agriculture, tourism, transport and
                         others. The proposed lab will also aim to impart technical skills to
                         students,entrepreneurs and innovators through capacity building and technical
                         training activities in partnership with Industry and international strategic partners
			             through co-creation platforms. The lab aims to achieve this by being a center
                         that gives mobile application developers a platform to develop mobile
                         applications, validate and to launch them into the virtual mobile market
                          ecosystems. <br>

			<h5>INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS RESEARCH LAB</h5>
			
			        <p>
						The planned Intelligent Systems Research lab will be concerned with design
                        and analysis of autonomous agents. In modern software design, Intelligent
                        Systems are becoming more and more crucial to success of systems, because
                        the types of problems encountered require dealing with very complex problems
                        (such as automated driving), complex data, as well as large quantities of data,
                        and real time decision making. The lab is being set up under management by the
                        Decision and Intelligent Systems cluster in the department.
                        <br>The planned Intelligent Systems Research lab focus will be on both theoretical
                        and applied research. Theoretical research will look into issues such as support
                        for faster search algorithms, with appropriate data structures and heuristics.
                        Applied research will look at problem solving in areas that are of great relevance
                        Botswana as well as Southern Africa, such as health care, mining, education,
                        and business. The lab will be supported by an undergraduate stream in the
                        Bachelor of Computer Science programme in the department. We expect to
                        support undergraduate research, through final year projects, to better prepare
                        undergraduate students for graduate research. Naturally, the MSc and PhD
                        programmes will feed into the lab. There is already great interest among
                        graduate students to pick topics in Artificial Intelligence, due to it being a hot
                        research area.  <br>

			<h5>HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING</h5>
					<p>
					     The Computer Science department is setting up a High Performance Computing
                         (HPC) Data centre and infrastructure to provide a HPC-As-A-Service to the
                         university. The department has a vision to develop capacity for teaching and
                         research in High Performance Computing and Big Data Science and to
                         concretely contribute to the University of Botswana research intensification
                         strategy.<br>
                         <br>The HPC facility aims to provide a consolidated service for specialized HPC
                         computational resource requirements across the university and to immediately
                        provide research level computational resources to the Faculty of Science
                        particularly in Computational Chemistry, Physics and Computational Science,
                        Mathematical modelling,  <br>
