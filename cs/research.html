            <h3>HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DEPARTMENT COMPUTER SCIENCE RESEARCH</h4>
			<p class="text-justify">
				Computer Science department is engaged and committed to incept projects of institutional and national importance in the themes of Research,
				Innovation and Technology Transfer. These projects involve local, regional and international collaborations and networks and building strategic
				partnerships.
			<br/><br/>
			The overarching aims of the projects are to:</p>
			<ul class="text-justify">
				<li>Strengthen the Department of Computer Science and University's 
				research capacity- this is to provide a concrete realization of the 
				university research strategy and vision;</li>
				<li> Stimulate multidisciplinary intra and inter faculty research,</li>
				<li>Enhance local, regional and international collaborations and to provide
					outreach and visibility.</li>
				<li>Develop capacity in Innovation, Technology Transfer and Intellectual
					Property</li>
				<li>Stimulation of grassroots innovation and interfacing with Technology
					Transfer Offices and Incubators.</li> <br>
			</ul>

							The main aim of the research cluster is to provide a centre to bring together
							people and projects which are concerned with undertaking research in the field of
							health informatics, especially mobile health which is relevant for a country with
							low resources such as Botswana.<br />The cluster has secured a laboratory at the
							Faculty of health Sciences which currently has 5 Personal computers dedicated
							to 5 specific projects.

							The department is setting up a Mobile Computing Research and Innovation Lab
							(MCRL).<br />MCRL aims to provide capacity building and upskilling of researchers,
							innovators, and entrepreneurs to help in exploring technology intervention in
							solving local problems.<br />The proposed lab will stimulate research and innovation
							in mobile computing and applications to find technology solutions of local
							relevance across sectors of health, education, agriculture, tourism, transport and
							others. The proposed lab will also aim to impart technical skills to
							students, entrepreneurs and innovators through capacity building and technical
							training activities in partnership with Industry and international strategic partners
							through co-creation platforms.<br />The lab aims to achieve this by being a center
							that gives mobile application developers a platform to develop mobile
							applications, validate and to launch them into the virtual mobile market
							ecosystems.

					<div class="collapse panel-collapse text-justify" id="isrl">
						<div class="panel-body">
							The planned Intelligent Systems Research lab will be concerned with design
							and analysis of autonomous agents. In modern software design, Intelligent
							Systems are becoming more and more crucial to success of systems, because
							the types of problems encountered require dealing with very complex problems
							(such as automated driving), complex data, as well as large quantities of data,
							and real time decision making. The lab is being set up under management by the
							Decision and Intelligent Systems cluster in the department.<br />
							The planned Intelligent Systems Research lab focus will be on both theoretical
							and applied research. Theoretical research will look into issues such as support
							for faster search algorithms, with appropriate data structures and heuristics.
							Applied research will look at problem solving in areas that are of great relevance
							Botswana as well as Southern Africa, such as health care, mining, education,
							and business. The lab will be supported by an undergraduate stream in the
							Bachelor of Computer Science programme in the department. We expect to
							support undergraduate research, through final year projects, to better prepare
							undergraduate students for graduate research. Naturally, the MSc and PhD
							programmes will feed into the lab. There is already great interest among
							graduate students to pick topics in Artificial Intelligence, due to it being a hot
							research area.

							research in High Performance Computing and Big Data Science and to
							concretely contribute to the University of Botswana research intensification
							strategy.<br>
							<br>The HPC facility aims to provide a consolidated service for specialized HPC
							computational resource requirements across the university and to immediately
							provide research level computational resources to the Faculty of Science
							particularly in Computational Chemistry, Physics and Computational Science,
							Mathematical modelling.
