2.1.3 Departmental Regulations 

2.1.4 Entry Requirements 

Admission into the programmes shall be as specified in the relevant Faculty Regulations. In
addition, the following departmental Special Regulations shall apply:
 
1)  For entry at the 100 level, the candidates must have a BGCSE / equivalent with:- 
a.) a minimum of grade D in English Language
b.) grade C in Mathematics and
c.)  
i) grades of C in any two from Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Studies,
OR 
ii) a minimum of grade BB in Science Double Award OR
iii) a minimum of grade A in Physical Science and grade C in Biology or its
equivalent
 
2) For entry at the higher level:- 
a.) transfer students from a Computer Science or equivalent program from a higher 
institution considered equivalent to the University of Botswana, subject to General
Academic Regulation 00.313. 
b.) candidates holding a post Secondary qualification which is considered by the
department as being at least equivalent to the 100-level of the programme. For those
who do not meet this criterion, they may be required to take some 100-level courses. 
2.1.5 Assessments 
 Final grade for all courses will be calculated as average of Continuous Assessment (CA) marks 
and Final Examination marks except where it is otherwise specified.
 Duration of Final Examinations – 2 or 3 hours.
 CA marks will be calculated based on at least three assessments for a course
 Specific requirements for CA marks calculations shall be as specified for each course. 
However, normally the CA to Examination ration is 1:1 for lab-based courses with 1:2
otherwise. 
 Final Year Project  
i) The Final Year Project is offered in semester 8.
ii) Assessment will be on the basis of a project’s analysis, design and its 
implementation; implementation’s “Alpha and beta” versions and the final version
of project, which includes the analysis, design, implementation and documentation.
Assessment will also be based on a demonstration of the working version of the
project’s implementation and knowledge, a demonstration to the supervisor and 1
co-examiner from the Department and in addition, a formal presentation of the
project to the Department will normally be required. 
iii) Detailed student project guideline shall be provided in each academic session.
2.1.6 Progression
