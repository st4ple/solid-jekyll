    message: "Dean’s Welcome: I wish you a warm welcome to the Faculty of Science at the University of Botswana. The Faculty consists of seven Departments, namely: Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Geology, Mathematics and Physics. The undergraduate programmes are offered in each of the Departments as a single major. Combined majors and minors are also possible as a BSc General degree. In addition, the Faculty offers focused programmes in such areas as Applied Geophysics, Physics with Meteorology, Radiation and Health Physics, Bachelor of Information Systems, Computing with Finance etc, for relevant applications in the graduates’ future careers. The Faculty also offers the basic foundation content to programmes offered in other Faculties such as Engineering and Technology, Health Sciences, Medicine and Education (Science Education). The Faculty is, without a doubt, the gateway to very exciting science- and technology-based careers that are in high demand for economic development. In the past few years since 2010 we have received over one thousand students per year taking our first year courses with a significant steady annual increase. Research is carried out through graduate programmes of Masters and PhD, and through projects by academic staff members in the various disciplines. Modern laboratory facilities are housed in various departments, and include shared facilities such as the Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopes, X-Ray Diffraction Spectrometer, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer etc. The faculty is also a host to a number of research centres and focus areas. Continuous engagement with stakeholders and partners is conducted through advisory committees and by consultations, workshops, seminars, conferences, exchange programmes, collaborations and cooperation. The Faculty intends to stay relevant and bench mark to maintain high academic standards. I hope that your association with the Faculty of Science leaves a positive and fruitful experience."
