TODO
====

* [ ] Validate to ensure IDs are unique throughout
* [ ] Update timestamps on all the sitemaps
* [ ] Push it all through a lint or prettifier to fix up Narbeh's hinky indenting
* [X] Attribution use case in ecommerce-solutions.html looks weird
* [X] Narbeh to sort out the ecommerce-solutions.html `id="service"` thing, which seems to be keyed to #service but IDs should be unique. Font sizes in the div are all fucked up too.
* [X] Edit the About page once Narbeh has sorted out the version in `_layouts/`
* [ ] The hero image in the about template doesn't responsively resize
* [ ] Make About page headshots have 2 or 3 per row instead of current layout
