Storytelling in unconventional color.
    Imagine that you have a box of crayons. If you focus on one crayon, you are probably going to forget about the beauty of the other colors. Unconventional color means that you have a diverse mindset and use all the crayons in the box. I apply this to diversity in race, ethnicity, the beauty of other cultures, and art.

Supporting the arts and its collaboration with tech.
    I started off as an artist and I found out that I liked technology too, when I joined the animation subteam for Robotics in high school. I would like for them both to be combined and equally supported because they can both be used to bring out interesting worlds.

The Ebony Xscape.
    We all need to find a way to xscape from the world. There are things and people that drive us crazy. I've prayed to God and he has blessed me to find ways to xscape the world with art. I think we can xscape together and take time to really feel, talk, and think.
