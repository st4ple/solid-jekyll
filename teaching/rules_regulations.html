            <h4>Homework Assignments</h4>
            <div class="hline"></div>
                <p>Completed assignments must be <a href="/teaching/login_information">uploaded to Moodle</a> using the <a href="/teaching/submission_format">correct format</a>.</p>
            <h4>Lab Assignments</h4>
            <div class="hline"></div>
                <p>Lab assignments are not submitted through Moodle. Instead, print the lab-sheet and bring it to the lab. Here you will follow the instructions and fill in the sheet.</p>
                <p>At the end of each lab, the lab-sheets will be collected. <b>If I do not receive the lab-sheet at the end of the lab, that session will be counted as a 0.</b></p>
            <h4>Assignment Affirmation</h4>
            <div class="hline"></div>
                <p>Ensure that the internal program documentation at the top of each .java file includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Name</i></li>
                    <li><i>Section Number</i></li>
                    <li>Affirmation: <i>I affirm that this program is entirely my own work and none of it is the work of any other person.</i></li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Integrity of Program and Output</h4>
            <div class="hline"></div>
                <p>Submitting an assignment requires that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The output is exactly that produced by the program</li>
                    <li>The source code is the exact version of the program that produced the output</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Submitting falsified output constitutes academic misconduct and will not be tolerated.</p>
